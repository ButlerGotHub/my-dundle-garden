The [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Factions/Cult of Balance/Cult of Balance\|Cult of Balance]] is inhabiting the Sunken Grotto. They are attempting to summon as powerful of an entity from [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Locations/Beyond the Mundane/The Elemental Chaos/The Elemental Chaos\|The Elemental Chaos]] (EC). 

[[DnD/R&D Notes/7 - Tools to look at/TableTopAudio (USE)\|Audio]]:
- 60s computer lab

R&D:
- Originally a storage and research facility for [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Locations/Continents/The Gilded Coast/The Sunlight Citadel/The Sunlight Citadel\|The Sunlight Citadel]].
- After the The SC, [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Locations/Continents/The Gilded Coast/Asheborne/Guilds/The Phantom Thieves'\|The Phantom Thieves']] (PT) took over, and after the thieves', the cultists took over.
- The PT left traps that only members would know of.
- At the bottom there was a small, stable portal to [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Locations/Beyond the Mundane/The Plane of Air/The Plane of Air\|The Plane of Air]] to act as an air vent for fresh air at the bottom of the facility.
- The cult is now trying to tear open the portal and redirect it to the EC to pull and elemental out of it.
- The dungeon is dotted with 'Cleansing Stations' to heal Short Rest ([[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/z Mechanical Information/Resting - Safe Haven Rules\|Resting - Safe Haven Rules]])
- Maybe after the exploration, the Grotto can act as either a portal hub, or at least a portal to the Plane of Air.
- You can hear the chanting of the cultist through the air vents. This is to give hints that the summoning is picking up pace and/or nearing completion.
- Random encounters can include maybe cultists, [[Twisted\|Twisted]], critters, or maybe even elementals leaking from the summoning.
- Some enemies could be old golems designed to moved either dangerous/heavy materials
- Maybe a crevice connecting floors? Probably more applicable to the Caldera or the Glacial Peaks...
- Maybe utilize teleporter? They were originally used to transport materials around the facility
- The golems are powered by 3rd lvl [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/z Mechanical Information/Items/Magic Items/Multi-Tiered Items/Mana Fuse\|Mana Fuse]]s, which the party can loot.


Mechanics and Design:
- 7 floors, 6th and 7th are only accessible through teleporters. 
- 4th floor is the only access to the 6th floor, 5th floor is the only access to the 7th floor.
- The 6th floor is a locked research room. Contains the brunt of the magic items/rewards. However, the most powerful object is on the 7th floor.
- The 7th floor is the “boiler room” containing utilities works and also the rift to the Plane of Air. This is where the lector and a couple priests of the cultists
- In the dungeon in total there are 20 cultists.
- TAB 1 Lector (Worth 3)
- 1 Priest (Worth 2)
- 1 Ritualist (Worth 2)
- 4 acolytes (Worth 1)
- 13 initiates (Worth 1)
- The final boss may be unable to be defeated if not enough cultists are killed.
- The aspect ascends floors straight up every three rounds if CW > 5 and every two >10, every round >15

- If the [[DnD/Campaigns or World/The Broken Planet/The Expedition (Current)/Locations/Beyond the Mundane/The Elemental Chaos/Aspect of Chaos\|Aspect of Chaos]] makes it to Asheborne, Lotund will learn the secrets of elemental fire. With that, he will gain fire damage to his attacks and resistance to fire
- d
- The elevators are broken on both sides.
- The stairs are broken to allow limited travel.
- Can use old, crumbling keys as door keys.
- Provide an item that can assist somehow in the dungeon with limited use above ground.
- d
- Traps can be aged infrastructure rather than hostile traps.
- Hostile traps would exist though from the thieves' guild...

### **The Grammarian's Spellbook**
*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

While you are holding this book, it grants you the following benefits:

- You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
- When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus; you regain one use per day and all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
- When you cast a spell using this spellbook, you may swap one letter in the spell you cast with another letter of the alphabet. This may dramatically alter the effects of the spell, but cannot change its power level to beyond similar effects of that spell level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus; you regain one use per day and all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Minyore's Minute Immutable Globe
_1th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 10ft (2.5-foot radius)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 2.5-foot radius around a point in range and remain for the duration. The globe must be able to fully surround an object for this spell to work.

Any spell of 1st level or lower cast from inside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects outside of it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects outside of the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area outside the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 1st.

### **The Grammarian's Spellbook**
*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

While you are holding this book, it grants you the following benefits:

- You gain a new spell list akin to a Wizard. You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
- When you cast a spell, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus; you regain one use per day and all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
- When you cast a spell using this spellbook, you may swap one letter in the spell you cast with another letter of the alphabet. This may dramatically alter the effects of the spell, but cannot change its power level to beyond similar effects of that spell level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus; you regain one use per day and all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

##### Spellbook
Your spellbook is the repository of all spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

**_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a Arcane spell scroll of 1st level or higher, you can add its spell to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 25 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

**_The Book's Appearance._** The book appears to be two hewn slabs of pure copper binding a few thick pages. The only blank page in the book is the last page.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells
You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
